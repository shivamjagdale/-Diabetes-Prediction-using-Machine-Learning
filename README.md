# -Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Here we are building a Machine Learning system that can predict weather a person has diabetes or not.
Here we will be using Support Vector Machine which falls under Supervised Learning and under Regression which is used to calculate values. 

Here we are going to train our model with several information such as glucose and insulin levels. 

Workflow for this project will be:- getting the data, standardizing the data, splitting the data then feeding this data to our SVM and then giving new data to SVM and asking it to predict if a patient has diabetes or not.
